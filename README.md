# Initialization-and-Implementation-of-SmartCards
In this project, we developed smartcard-based applications for two use-cases:

  - Commercial :  A universitary restaurant application that allows students to refill their cards and use them to buy meals (Electronic purse)
  - Administrative : An application that allows students to download their transcripts and other administrative documents from the department's server after authentication.
  
Both applications use two-way authentication (Smart Card and PIN code) in addition to digital certificates and cryptography to guarantee security.
